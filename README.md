   - Build a credit scoring model to assess the credit risk of individuals or businesses. Use
      historical data to train the model and predict the likelihood of default for new applicants


     
Introduction :

Financial decision-making, assessing the risk associated with loan applications is a critical task for lending institutions. 
The ability to accurately predict whether a borrower is likely to default on a loan can significantly impact the overall success 
and stability of a financial portfolio. In this mini project, we delve into the world of credit risk prediction using machine learning techniques.
                 To achieve this, we employ the Random Forest algorithmâ€”a powerful ensemble learning technique known for its effectiveness in 
                 classification tasks. Through the use of R programming language and relevant libraries, we preprocess the data, explore key 
                 features, and train a Random Forest model on a subset of the dataset. Following model training, we evaluate its performance on
                 a test set and subsequently apply the model to predict credit risk for new loan applicants.
